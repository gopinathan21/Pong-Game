# Beginner JavaScript Pong Game

## To Implement

1. **Variable Ball Speed and Direction**: Implement the ability to control the speed and direction of the ball, making the game more challenging and dynamic.

2. **Common Level**: Create a common level that players can progress through, with increasing difficulty as they continue playing.

3. **Improved Styling**: Enhance the game's visual appeal by customizing elements such as background color to make the game more engaging.

4. **Refined Logic**: Implement more refined collision and gameplay logic to create a smoother and more intuitive gaming experience.
5. **Ball collision** : collisions between balls and changing direction may be a good idea

## Bugs

1. **Collision and Ball Speed Issue**: Address the bug where simultaneous mouse movement events and collisions cause the ball's speed to fluctuate, resulting in unintended behavior. Implement a solution to ensure consistent ball movement.
